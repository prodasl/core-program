# Private token airdrop ZK tool project proposal.

## Summary of System Features
#### Depositing Tokens:
The sender can deposit a certain number of tokens to the custody smart contractâ€™s liquidity pool.
#### Assigning Tokens:
The sender can use a CSV list with assigned values (address, amount, expiration date) to assign an available balance on the custody smart contract to the beneficiaries detailed in the CSV file.
#### Generating ZKP:
A beneficiary can get a ZKP that proves they are the owner of a specific wallet address.
#### Checking Balance:
Beneficiaries can consult their balance using their ZKP.
#### Transferring Tokens:
A beneficiary can use their ZKP to transfer tokens to other wallets from their available balance on the custody smart contract without revealing their own wallet address.
#### Multiple Deposits and Assignments:
The sender can do multiple deposits and assignments based on the liquidity balance.
